For every 500 contributions I make, I create a new repository.
The most current repository is InstaPrint Pro.


All repositories include a VersION file so you can see upcoming updates.

Apology: If you are in constant reliability of my REPO's,
changes may expect a bumpy ride since many ethical difficulties 
have been encountered. 
Thank you so much for your patience. -The3DP

>More about VersION
##
VersION is the largest addition to the user convinience
department when using my Repositories. 
It is a easy reading, helpful info giving, and
justifying platform. All of my Repositories are currently underway 
and will (eventually) fully support the VerSION file.
##
How to use: In order to interact with the VersION, Click on 
the VersION file in my repository(ies). 
NOTE: Different VersION files may vary.
Key Tips (if needed).
