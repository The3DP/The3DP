RTS (Recommended Testing Sites)

RTS will appear on
most of my HTML repositories. This tells you mostly any 
online sites you can visit to test and run my code. Just plug and play (copy and paste).

For some reason, my number of contributions went down from around 1,200 to 1,076.
 I do not know how this happened, but it is pretty strange.
 Github, if you are reading this, than PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE.
For now on, I am pausing any activity out of fear that Github will erase my contributions.
Thank you dfor understanding.
