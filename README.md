Apology: If you are in constant reliability of my REPO's,
changes may expect a bumpy ride since many ethical difficulties 
have been encountered. 
Thank you so much for your patience. -The3DP

More about VersION
##
VersION is the largest addition to the user convinience
department when using my Repositories. 
It is a easy reading, helpful info giving, and
justifying platform. All of my Repositories are currently underway 
and will (eventually) fully support the VerSION file.
##
How to use: In order to interact with the VersION, Click on 
the VersION file in my repository(ies). 
NOTE: Different VersION files may vary.
Key Tips (if needed).

One - = 10% for Updates.
One - = 20% for stats affirmed.

RTS
##
RTS stands for Recommended Testing Sites, and will appear on
most of my HTML repositories. This tells you mostly any 
online sites you can visit to test and run my code. Just plug and play (copy and paste).
